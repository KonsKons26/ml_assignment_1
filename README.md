# First project for the 'Machine Learning' Course

This was a group assignment for four member teams. The instructions for the assignment are in [this file](MACHINE_LEARNING_1st_assignment_2024-2025.pdf) and our solution is in [this notebook](Assignment.ipynb).

To re-run the notebook you will have to create a virtual environment using the following:
```bash
python3 -m venv .my_env
source .my_env/bin/activate
pip install requirements.txt
```
